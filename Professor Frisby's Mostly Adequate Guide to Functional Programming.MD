# Chapter 2: First Class Functions
https://drboolean.gitbooks.io/mostly-adequate-guide/content/ch2.html

First part of this chapter is about remembring that functions can be assigned to variables.
Second is about seeing where there is no need for additional function. Example with `ajaxCall` makes it obvious.

Example with controller calling views and having all those functions for no reason is great as well.

Argument with generic code is great, the same function can be reused if it's name is generic eg. `compact` but not if it's called `validArticles`.

Great argument for thisless, I have lost interest in it as well. Still think about this in context of other libraries.
