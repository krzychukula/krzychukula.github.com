― Scott Berkun

“There are only two kinds of languages: the ones people complain about and the ones nobody uses.”

“Be conservative in what you do, be liberal in what you accept from others (often reworded as "Be conservative in what you send, be liberal in what you accept”

“It's important for nerds to realize, too, that school is not life. School is a strange, artificial thing, half sterile and half feral. It's all-encompassing, like life, but it isn't the real thing. It's only temporary, and if you look, you can see beyond it even while you're still in it.”
— Paul Graham, Hackers & Painters: Big Ideas from the Computer Age

“One of the lessons we learned from running the pilot groups of the course, was that developing small projects was a good way to shift yourself out of a rut and back onto the rapid part of the learning curve.

— Scott Young (Top Performer course)

“In the meantime, ask yourself this: Are your the skills that matter for having a career you love improving as you’d like? If not, how could you improve the speed and quality of feedback you get to escape the Doctor’s Paradox.”
— Scott Young (Top Performer course)

“ninety percent of everything is crap”
— Sturgeon's revelation (Sturgeon's law)

“90% of everything is crap. That is true, whether you are talking about physics, chemistry, evolutionary psychology, sociology, medicine—you name it—rock music, country western. 90% of everything is crap.”
— Daniel Dennett

“Most things are bullshit - don't trust mass opinion”
— Pieter Hintjens
